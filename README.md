 ## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Backend Developer** and advanced university student in Software Development, focused on building **clean, efficient, and maintainable backend systems**.

I mainly work with **Java and Kotlin**, using **Spring Boot** to develop RESTful APIs and backend services. I have experience with **relational databases (SQL)**, version control with **Git**, and working in **Linux environments**.

I consider myself a curious and analytical person, always eager to learn, improve my skills and continuous practice.  
I strongly believe in taking **small daily steps** to achieve long-term growth, both professionally and personally 🚀
